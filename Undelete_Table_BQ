We can undelete big query table using table snapshot decorators and ‘FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF’. 
Deleted table will be available in big query temporary location for some time. So it is possible to retrieve your data that were deleted within the last few days .

Limits:
We can’t undelete the table in following situations.

When Table dropped :
•	You have recreated new table with same name.
•	Tables which were deleted time is more than 2 days.
If rows deleted but table not dropped :
•	You can only undelete rows that were deleted within the last 7 days.


Syntax : 
INSERT INTO `project.dataset.table`
SELECT * FROM `project.dataset.table`
FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2020-05-19 18:10:00';

Or using command line-

bq cp `project.dataset.table@1589929800000` `project.dataset.table`

Note :- make sure to convert timestamp '2020-05-19 18:10:00' in milliseconds  ‘1589929800000’. We can do that using below Unix command. 

$date -d '2020-05-19 18:10:00' +"%s"  
Result will be in seconds – 1589929800. Now multiply this with 1000 to convert seconds into milliseconds.

Example :- 

Let’s say by mistake we deleted few rows using below sql.
delete from `sample_project.sample_dataset.sample_table`
where 1=1;
--4 rows removed.

We want to reinsert these rows and we now these rows were available in this table on '2020-05-19 18:10:00'.
Simply use any of below 2 options to recover the deleted rows.

INSERT INTO `sample_project.sample_dataset.sample_table`
SELECT * FROM `sample_project.sample_dataset.sample_table`
FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2020-05-19 18:10:00';
--4 rows added.

OR

bq cp sample_project:sample_dataset.sample_table@1589929800000 sample_project:sample_dataset.sample_table

Result : Tables 'sample_project:sample_dataset.sample_table@1589929800000' successfully copied to 'sample_project:sample_dataset.sample_table'

Here We are trying to read from the table as of before the delete happened and then inserting into the same itself (which as of now is empty). This is a very handy functionality that you may end up using often.

Hope this will be helpful. Thanks!!
